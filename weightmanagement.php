                                        </li>

                                    <p>The Udwarthanam massage is a therapeutic deep tissue massage which is performed with herbal powder applied in upward strokes. The intensity of the massage generates heat which then melts the excess fat in your body. Hence, the Udwarthanam Ayurvedic massage is a great and very effective program among slimming treatments. Besides, it can also work very well to improve the immunity and lymphatic flow of the body.

                                   The Udwarthanam treatment stimulates the nervous system, soothes the nerve endings and improves blood circulation. Hence, it is used in the treatment of sciatica, muscle stiffness, paralysis, sclerosis, obesity, and skin-related disorders.

It is beneficial in bringing down the Kapha toxins and detoxifying the body.
It helps to prevent cholesterol-related issues.
It can be used to cure oedema, a condition characterised by the presence of excessive watery fluid in the cavities or tissues of the body.
The therapy has also been known to treat diseases like hemiplegia, rheumatoid arthritis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson’s disease, motor neuron disorders, etc.

Panchakarma is a great treatment modality for Ayurvedic weight loss treatment. It would give the much needed rest to your digestive system, while removing the toxins from your body at the same time. However, the weight loss program will not be a rapid one and there are no shortcuts. 
</p>
                    
<p>Our Ayurveda physicians would have a detailed discussion with you to understand your health conditions, to rule out any underlying health problems, followed by a treatment pattern that will be suitable for your body constitution. There will be diet programs and physical and mental exercises to help you get successful in the Ayurvedic weight loss treatment.  Following them diligently will definitely bring results.

<li class="prt-list-li-content">
Obesity, Causes and Symptom </li>

 <p>Obesity, in medical terms, could be due to certain conditions. But in Ayurveda, the excess body weight is due to an elevation of the Kapha dosha. When the body has a slow metabolism, caused by the Agni and Kapha vitiation, it can lead to excessive weight gain. If it is not a medical condition, then the faulty fat metabolism could be as a result of excessive consumption of oily snacks, sweet and sugary delicacies and cold foods. Also not eating regular meals and skipping them altogether can cause weight gain. Fat gets deposited in various parts of the body like the stomach area, thighs, hips, arms, breasts and so on. We will assess your situation as part of the slimming treatments and then suggest a treatment pattern.
