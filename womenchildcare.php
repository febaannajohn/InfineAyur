 <p>Ayurvedic women and child care rules lay out solid action plans to ensure the health of women and children. In India, women are ascribed divinity, solely because of their ability to give birth to a child and thereby retaining the human race on the face of earth.</p>
                              
 <p>According to Ayurveda women and children are no separate entities but inseparable factors. This is because the health of the woman during pregnancy directly affects the health of the baby. Any post-natal disease to the mother can also deprive the child of essential nutrients in the form of breast milk.

</p>          

<p>This branch of Ayurveda deals with impotence, infertility, prenatal, natal and postnatal care. Neonatal care has significant importance according to Ayurvedic concepts. The care given to a newborn child is equivalent to a life-time of health care. The right treatments and care given to a newborn baby at the right times will ensure healthy development of the child as a person and conttributing member to the society.</p>
        

<h3>Mother and baby care
</h3>
<p>In the science, Ayurveda, the days after birth are a sacred period. its a time of rest, self-care, and love.

Each person naturally leans toward one dosha and this affects their body type, temperament and health.
</p>

<p>When you give birth, your vata increases because of the now empty abdomen, loss of fluids and blood, and decreased energy, creating an imbalance in the body often leading to postpartum anxiety.

Ayurveda care is to counter vata, heal from childbirth and set yourself on a path of health and balance in the future.
</p>
<p>
Ayurvedic texts suggest that the first forty-two days after giving birth should be focused on rest, rejuvination and bonding with your newborn, after the incredible changes your body, mind and spirit have just gone through.
The focus of this healing period is to bring the vata dosha into balance, restore the reproductive tissues, and promote healthy lactation channels. This ensures the mother’s health is cared for and in turn, allows for better bonding between mother and baby.
</p>
<p> Co-sleeping is a great way for new moms to rest when their baby is sleeping without feeling as anxious.

Women may experience postpartum depression. She may be unable to bond with their newborn, and many experience guilt for the same long after they have recovered. We givr Ayurveda care for the same
So at a minimum, it is recommend for a new mama to spend atleast her first two weeks postpartum in a state of complete rest.
</p>

<p>Due to the high vata in your body, your digestive fire, or agni, is compromised. Since digestion itself takes a considerable amount of energy, during this time, it’s especially important to fuel your body with foods that are easy to digest, so your body has the maximum energy for performing it’s primary functions – including postpartum recovery and lactation

</p>
<p>Between breastfeeding, taking care of a newborn and the lack of sleep, many new moms forget to nourish themselves at regular intervals and find their energy levels or milk supply drop. So besides eating the right foods, it’s important to eat small meals at regular intervals, too – and keep your vata in check.

Sometimes it works well to time your food intake with your baby’s feeds. For example, if you’re breastfeeding, eat something before/during/after every feed. This way, you’ll always be replenishing your body to provide energy for the next feed.
</p>
<p>
Another simple way to calm vata is sleeping with an eye pillow and light scarf around the top of your head and ears to help induce melatonin (the “sleep hormone”), which can help you fall asleep better through the new-mom postpartum anxiety phase.
Oil massages for mother and baby will balance out the vata dosha, ground the new mother, and allow her to be fully present in her new role. 
</p>
<p>Oil is nourishing and dense (opposite to the qualities of air, which we associate with postpartum anxiety). This will not only help strengthen your body but add heat and flexibility to your tissues and muscles, too.
</p>
<p>After a massage and necessary personal treatments take a medicated hot shower called Vethukuli, then wrap your abdomen with a bellyband or a long piece of cloth to offer support to the uterus and help tone the muscles in your stomach.

All these general treatments with personal care brings the physique back to normalcy.</p>
