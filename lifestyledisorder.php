                                        </h3> -->
                                        <p class="desc">Lifestyle disorders are  diseases that occur on the basis of living habits and lifestyle of people. They also occur due to the relationship of the people with their respective environments. The important factors that accord to lifestyle disorders are low physical activity, food habits, disturbed sleeping patterns, competitive living, and incorrect body posture.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The most common familial causes of these lifestyle disorders are related to diet — consuming unhealthy foods, uncontrolled eating, overindulgence on artificial sweeteners, processed foods, and junk foods. In addition, addictive habits like tobacco smoking, eating paan, consumption of alcohol, irregular sleeping habits, very limited exposure to sun and fresh air, stress and modern-day urbanization have made matters worse. The most frequently observed lifestyle disorders are diabetes, obesity, hypothyroidism, cancer, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                                
                                   
                                    <p >The amount and duration of physical exercise, the type and time of work, irregular sleeping habits, poor posture, etc., are few factors which decide the onset of these lifestyle disorders. Activities like smoking and alcohol in the youth can lead to a reduction in the individual’s stamina and in the long run, is likely to cause multiple diseases.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
Coming to the heart disease, it is not a single condition or a single disease. It relates to a cluster of diseases wherein the heart vessels are damaged and cannot function to the fullest. Much of the heart diseases we see are due to a sedentary lifestyle and irregular eating habits. Most commonly found heart diseases are high blood pressure and atherosclerosis. Diseases like asthma, cancers of the lung and oral cavity, and COPD are associated with smoking, alcoholism, and diet poor in vitamins and proteins.

                                    <h3>Lifestyle disorders complications</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>Lifestyle disorders can become highly complicated if unattended on time and may need a prolonged treatment procedure. Complications in case of diabetes happen over a period of time. Diabetic individuals have a high chance of developing cardiovascular diseases, various infections, and diseases damaging the kidneys, nerves, dental cavity, and eyes.
                                    </p>

                                    
                                    <p>High blood sugar levels will increase the dangers of heart attack, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and may often lead to kidney failure. If the wounds are not treated well, physicians may even recommend amputation. Hypertension is associated with congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, hypertensive retinopathy, and uremia. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) is a major complication of respiratory system failure and is associated with difficulty in taking breath, confusion, and lung infections. Excess weight (obesity) increases the risk for many complications like cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, osteoarthritis, and stones in the gallbladder.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
Alcoholism is another important lifestyle disorder that can cause alcoholic hepatitis, gastritis, cancers of the mouth, throat, liver, and colon, elevated blood pressure levels, and irregular menstruation in women and erectile dysfunction in men.
</p>
                         
<p>Osteoporosis is a lifestyle complication where the bones become too thin and breakable, increasing the risk for fractures. In majority of the cases, bones tend to lose their strength when there are low levels of calcium, phosphorous, and other important minerals.  Osteoporosis mainly occurs in hip, wrist and spine. Fractures that occur from osteoporosis are more common in women than in men, and the risk increases with age.</p>
